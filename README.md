# C_plus_plus_particle_fire_explosion_program

This is a C++ project i did where i created a beautiful particle fire explosion program which is a particle motion application with various colors that change up every so often and lots of different movements and speed that runs on your terminal, its very cool application that can be very calming and hypnotic to look at. 

This is a project i completed from learning and taking the Udemy C++ complete tutorial that had over 80 lectures and you can earn a certificate once you have completed all the courses. Udemy offers lots of great It & software courses. Many of them are free to take. Here is a link to there web page: https://www.udemy.com/courses/it-and-software/

Instructor to the course was John Purcell a software development trainer who has decades worth of experience with C++ and he has is own website with lots of great learning material. Here is a link to his website: https://www.caveofprogramming.com/

I used simple direct media layer (SDL) and downloaded there libary. SDL is a cross platform software development library designed to provide a hardware abstraction layer for computer multimedia hardware components. You can find the downloads for there libaries at the SDL home web page here: https://www.libsdl.org/

I used visual studio IDE with C++ code.
To complete the project it took me a total of 7 files
which i listed and named below.

main.cpp

particle.cpp & particle.h

screen.cpp & screen.h

swarm.cpp & swarn.h
